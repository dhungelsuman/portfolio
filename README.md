# Suman Dhungel | Software Developer Portfolio

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Suman Dhungel â€” a software developer and network engineering student at Sheridan College. This is my personal portfolio where I show off my skills, projects, and everything tech-related.

The site is clean and mobile-friendly. You can jump around easily using the top menu or the sidebar on your phone. Check out who I am, what Iâ€™m good at, and what Iâ€™ve built so far.

In the About section, youâ€™ll find a quick intro, my resume ready to download, and links to my socials â€” GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram. Hit me up!

Skills? I got plenty. Python, Java, Spring Boot, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. These are the tools I play with every day.

Projects are where the magic happens. From a Spring Boot event website with login and ticketing, to a Python CSV analyzer, and an SQL dashboard app â€” these projects show my passion and skills in action.

Iâ€™m studying at Sheridan College, learning all about software dev and network engineering. Iâ€™ve taken courses like Data Structures, Network Security, and Software Engineering. Iâ€™m all about leveling up.

Want to chat? Use the contact form or find my email and phone right there. Iâ€™m easy to reach and love talking tech.

This portfolio is super lightweight and simple to host. Clone it, open `index.html`, and youâ€™re good to go.

Thanks for stopping by! Explore, connect, and letâ€™s build something cool together.

â€” Suman Dhungel ðŸš€
